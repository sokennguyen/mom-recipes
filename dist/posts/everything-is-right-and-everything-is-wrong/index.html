      <h1>Everything is right, and everything is wrong</h1>

<p>One things seems so right when you really squeeze out every inch of rationality to explain it.</p>
<p>But such thing is also true when you try and ration about the opposite ideas.</p>
<p>This is especially the case when we discuss about the meaning of life.<br>
&quot;What should we do with our lives&quot; have always been the debate since the dawn of the human intellect.</p>
<p>The debate doesn't have an ending, because all of the perspectives are logically correct.<br>
But then we look took another perspective, the original ideas of living are so wrong.</p>
<p>Pursuing monetary riches is the way to live, but living peacefully without the care of wealth also is the way to live.<br>
Both of them have their reasons to be correct, and reasons to be wrong when looking from the opposite viewpoint.</p>
<p>This is also the case for weighing the pursuit of art, love, competition, fame, and so on.</p>
<p>So since everything is right, and everything is wrong, I think that we should just choose something and go with it without further worries.</p>
<p>The decision will be right, yet still wrong, no matter what we choose.</p>
<p>The worst thing I can do is not deciding, and therefore not doing anything with my life.</p>
<p>Choosing how to live based on other people's opinions is one way to make that decision.<br>
Choosing not to listen to other people is the better option though, because you've made that choice with your own reasonings.</p>
<p>But whatever path I choose, I can be assured that sometimes I'll will think the decision is right, and wrong at other times.<br>
When I think it's wrong, I then will be able to decide to continue down that path or not.<br>
I then need to make that decision, with the knowledge that the decision will be both right, and wrong.</p>
<p>Choose your reason to live, and live with it.<br>
For the moment, ignore the other options.<br>
For the moment, your decision is right, and the others are wrong.<br>
Just live, and you've successfully living.</p>
<p>Note: Sometimes I wish that I'm stupid enough to just do things without considering other options.</p>
