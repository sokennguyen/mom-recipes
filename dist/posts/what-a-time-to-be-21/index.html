      <h1>What a time to be 21</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I would say go to uni or travel the world with your laptop and try and build little startups, by learning free code camp or whatever.</p>
<p>And meet a lot of people, talk to a lot different people. Be open. And it's normal to feel nervous.</p>
<p>It's normal to be socially awkward.</p>
<p>It's normal to be scared of everything.</p>
<p>But have a lot of different experiences. And I'm still trying to do that.</p>
<p>But man, it gets harder when you get older, your brain starts to avoid newness. And there's a psychological trade called openness to experiences and that's reduced with age, so you need to actively train it.</p>
<p>And it's so easy when you're 20, it's harder when you're 30.</p>
<p>So yeah, have fun.</p>
<p>You can go anywhere.</p>
<p>You can go to Uganda, you can go live there.</p>
<p>You can go live in Japan or in Uruguay or Chile.</p>
<p>Or if you're a European, you go live in New York. You've always wanna live in Brooklyn, go live in Brooklyn. It's fucking expensive though but yeah, try. I lived in Brooklyn just to be able to say I live in Brooklyn, like, it's so cool.</p>
<p>You can go, you can live anywhere.</p>
<p>And everywhere is kinda same. You have the internet.</p>
<p>Most places you can now live for $1,000 a month. Not the big cities, but a lot of other places outside America and Europe, you can live for $1000 a month.</p>
<p><strong>The world is your oyster.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What a time to be 21.</strong></p>
